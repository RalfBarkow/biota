This is Digitalk's version of Smalltalk=80's "file out" format.

A couple of steps:
* Download the file
* Transform it to UTF-8
* Rename it to an .st extension
* Inspect the file
* You will see a Script view with a File In button.
* Press on it. You will get a DNU because of a missing class creation method but that can be added temporarily.
